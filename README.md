### Heyo! 👋

My name is Chenxu Mao but feel free to call me Robin. I am currently a second UofT student.

--------

- Pronouns: he\him
- My projects here mainly demonstrate my declarative programming skills, however, I will focus more on my object oriented programming skills and update more projects in the future. 
- For my upcoming third year, I will focus more on application-based statistics, software development and data analytics.
- How to reach me: <robin.mao@mail.utoronto.ca>
- Fun fact: I also have a great sense of humour, if that matters. (If comp sci doesn't work for me a comedian works too)
